# Frontal Collision Warning project - python
#This Project is part of a undergraduate research on DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEM TO REDUCE TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS BY MEANS OF COLLISION AVOIDANCE ALERTS, promoted by Mackenzie Presbyterian University.
#The goal of this study is to develop a low cost embeeded system with Raspberry Pi 4 using Yolov5 with the Pi camera for object detection.

#To test the programm, download the yolov5 required packages through the cmd, using this command: pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/yolov5/master/requirements.txt

#The code developed is in the application.py file.

#The trained yolov5 model was exported to .onnx file in order to achieve better fps performance on CPU, and it is available as model.onnx

#The dataset used to train the yolov5 model network is available in roboflow: https://universe.roboflow.com/ic-8viu9/fcw_dataset
